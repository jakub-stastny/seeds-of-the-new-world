** Preamble
On Christmas Day of 2019, my long-time good friend Patricia entered a spontaneous trance and spoke as if guided by a deeper intelligence. Though she retained only the feeling, the message was clear: a global collapse is approaching. It won’t be instant or explosive, but will unfold like falling dominoes—triggered by the failure of the financial system. The collapse will strip away illusions: of stability, of wealth, of control. Many will suffer, and many will die—not as punishment, but as a necessary rebalancing. What follows is not the end, but the beginning of a simpler life rooted in essentials: food, shelter, love, and care. Those who align with what truly matters will find themselves prepared—not through stockpiles, but through inner clarity and communal strength.

#+begin_quote Patricia
I could be wrong but I believe that the cause will be the crash of financial systems. I suspect the trigger will be currency failures and that they will bring down stock markets, huge corporations and banks. That in turn will filter down to the ordinary man. I believe that this is what the markets thought was happening the last time and did everything to stave off but in doing so they have further undermined them so what little foundations and safety nets they had are now gone and they simply do not have the resilience for what is coming despite all their bank stress test talk. After all, if money fails then how can organisations that have money as their product/service survive?

In my opinion money has to fail because it is the single largest bubble in history. When bankers disassociated currency from gold in Bretton Woods after the Second World War (because they were bankrupt thanks to military spending) they created a pretence that money had value but what they did was con the public that a piece of paper was worth \$x. Now it is even worse because we don’t have pieces of paper but ones and zeros in computers and those ones and zeros can evaporate in fractions of a second. When people lose trust in currency the whole edifice has to fall. It is about time. Right now the billionaires invest at unrealistic valuations in startups and drive their value up and up by incentivising management to raise the stock price continuously. Then those same investors, with their insider knowledge, tip each other off and they get out of the investment leaving the ordinary man’s pension and savings funds to pick up stock that will in a matter of time plummet in value.

Because the consequences of all this carry-on can be hidden from the ordinary man for a long time by operating Ponzi-like schemes to pay the early people’s pensions, the money people have been getting away with it. But in time the Ponzi-effect runs out of liquid cash and can no longer pay out and then the house of cards collapses rapidly but it falls like a house of cards (or dominos) where is spreads by contagion - the whole lot does not fall in one go like an explosion. So we will see early signs if we keep our eyes and ears open.

I am no lover of property, particularly rental property, as an asset I’ve told you. I appreciate all the value it has been delivering and that it is more tangible than many other investments but when people can no longer pay their rent or afford property maintenance, it does not take long for a building to become derelict and then it’s only value is a as a site. My aim is to get out of debt because when this starts the banks will foreclose on everyone to call in debt so their senior people can personally get out as best they can. I also want to get as much of my assets into liquid form as possible. By that I means something that can be bartered - I’m not sure what yet because gold is expensive and not easy to use to trade when you are an individual wanting to buy a loaf of bread. I don’t think leaving it in savings in a bank is wise although we need to keep some there and just hope we can get most of it out when needed. So I need to identify what best to barter. I also think I would like to own my own home for safety, security and to avoid overcrowding.

I want to buy something small, detached, near a town but actually outside it in the countryside, somewhere that is easy and cheap to heat and somewhere we can grow some vegetables and have chickens and a spring/well/stream for water. I think producing food would protect ourselves and give us something to barter with for what we need which should be little enough. I suspect that utilities like internet, electricity, water, TV, etc. could and will fail on and off as governments will be bankrupt.

I make this sound like Armageddon but I don’t think it will be quite so bad as people lying dead on the side of the road scenario. Yet I do believe many people will die and there will be hardship, until we learn what’s important in life. One of the positives of this crash will be that climate change will be less of an issue because we won’t be screwing things up when everything collapses. We don’t need to be an old fashioned agrarian society but we do need balance … what the FOK (posh curse word in Dublin) do we think we are at when we are about to start space tourism, when we are spending billions preparing to have the billionaires relocate to mars after they have destroyed the earth with their greed, when VR headsets are being promoted for gaming instead of for helping elderly, lonely and people with dementia ….?

I can’t advise what will be best for you but you too will be ok because you will know what matters in life. You need to consider the ‘what if she is right question’ and ‘what happens afterwards question’. Then you need to prepare or ignore it as is right for you. For me, I must protect Ken from what is coming. He needs to know that he is 100\% safe and that life won’t change drastically - other than the fact he will have to find another use for his 55 inch smart TV :)

# Cities and suburbs will see shortages and riots and violence.
# Lots of people – Ukraine, Gaza, Africa… are hungry now because of those wars. But people are still screwing each other from greed at every opportunity. That has to come to a complete end very soon.

I've known Patricia for over a decade and she's a very capable psychic. Many people, including me, knew all along that things cannot go on like this for much longer, and specifically anti-globalisation protests in late 90s vocalised this sentiment of many, until they were silenced by post-9/11 crack downs. But later came the occupy movement, more and more knowledge of how exploitative global system works amongst normal people. After the pandemic astrologers and mediums were talking about the imminent collapse and as of early 2025, it's a thing that even popular actresses in MX talk about and people in our local yoga class. The cat is out of the bag.

The fact that the collapse is talked about by normal people means that it is no longer the future: it's the present. It has been ramping up gradually and now we're entering the free fall stage when things will disintegrate in a few short years.

#+begin_quote Patricia
  We are over-populated, greedy, uncaring, etc. and society needs a good kick in the ass to wake up to themselves so whilst many people will be lost and there will be great hardship we need to realign our priorities. Much as I like the latest piece of Apple equipment, it is not what life is about.
#+end_quote

This book however, is not alarmistic: I explain what is going on and why, so people understand what is it that went wrong and why the old system must fail and why is that a good thing. Once we get that out of the way, I want to get into what to replace it with. Welcome to the New World.

* Introduction
The collapse of our global systems was never a question of /if/ — only /when/. Built on endless growth in a finite world, they were designed to fail. Debt spirals, ecological exhaustion, social disintegration: the cracks are now impossible to hide.

We live in a world where millions are chronically lonely despite being hyper-connected, where rainforests are traded for short-term profit, where economic "growth" often measures destruction more than creation. These are not glitches; they are features of a system that has reached the end of its cycle.

This document draws on the study of failed empires, historical patterns like the Fourth Turning, and deeper energetic frameworks that most analyses ignore. Collapse is not random. It follows predictable arcs — both material and spiritual.

The goal here is not to mourn what's dying, but to understand why it's happening, what forces are shaping the transition, and how we can move wisely through it. The future will not be built by the institutions that caused the collapse. It will be built by individuals who see clearly and act with grounded courage.

No saviour is coming. The responsibility, and the opportunity, are ours. Will you take it?

** Signs of systemic failure

*** Financial system breakdown

The US is burning trust faster than dollars. Massive money printing, reckless spending, and Trump's new tariffs have only sped things up. Countries are ditching the dollar, trading in anything else they can. Meanwhile, within about 10 years, nearly all tax revenue will be eaten by debt interest and Medicare alone — leaving nothing for anything else. Faith in the system is draining fast. Without trust, the dollar dies. Without the dollar, the US can't function.

#+begin_example "What is inflation?" :type term
Inflation means that prices go up over time, so the money you have buys less than it did before. It usually happens when there’s too much money chasing too few goods, or when it costs more to make and deliver things. Some inflation is normal in a growing economy, but too much can hurt people—especially those with fixed incomes or savings, since their money loses value.

*Who controls inflation?* Inflation isn’t set like a number on a dial. It comes from many things in the economy, but central banks try to influence it. They do this by raising or lowering interest rates, or by changing how much money flows through the system. Governments also affect inflation by how they spend and borrow.

*How is inflation calculated?* Inflation is usually measured by checking the prices of a group of everyday goods and services—called a “basket”—and comparing them over time. This gives a percentage that shows how much prices have risen. But the way inflation is measured is often changed to make it look lower than it really is. The items in the basket can be swapped out for cheaper ones, or adjusted to say they’ve improved in quality (even if they cost more). These tricks make the official numbers look better, but they don’t reflect the real cost of living for most people.

#+begin_example "Can the US really default on their debt?"
  Not in the usual way. Most countries eventually go broke — they can't pay their debts. The US is different: it prints the world's reserve currency, so it can always hit "print" and pay[fn:1]. But here's the catch: printing money doesn't make the problem go away — it just shifts it. The more they print, the less that money is worth[fn:2]. At some point, people stop trusting the dollar[fn:3]. Then they dump it. And when trust dies, the dollar dies — and with it, the US economy as we know it[fn:ref:1].
#+end_example

  [fn:1] The US Treasury borrows money, but the Federal Reserve — technically independent — can create dollars to buy that debt if markets stop doing so.
  [fn:2] This is not a default in name, but it is in effect: if you're paid back in money that buys much less, you've still lost.
  [fn:3] Once global trust in the dollar breaks, trade contracts, foreign reserves, and energy deals start shifting elsewhere — which has already begun.

Fixing it means touching the untouchable. Raise taxes? Political suicide. Cut Medicare or Social Security? Same. Slash military spending? Not a chance. Meanwhile, stunts like Musk pushing DOGE are pure smokescreen — they fix nothing, but make it look like something's happening. The real problems are locked in and nobody dares touch them. The ship is at full speed, the iceberg is dead ahead, and the wheel is stuck. Everyone is busy arguing, but the crash is already certain.

And if you think this doesn't matter because you're not in the US, think again. In a globalised world, everything is linked — finance, trade, supply chains. It's not like the old days when one country could sink without dragging others down. Today it's all one pond. When the dollar goes, the shockwaves hit everyone.

*** End of cheap oil

The modern world runs on oil — and the cheap stuff is gone. What's left is buried deep, dirtier, harder to reach, and costs far more to pull out. Shale oil kept the illusion alive for a while, but it's already cracking. When oil prices jump, everything jumps: food, transport, medicine, heating, industry. Without cheap oil, cities choke, supply chains break, farming collapses. Feeding places like New York or Mexico City stops being logistics — it becomes survival. Solar panels and electric cars won't fix it. They run on supply chains too, and those chains are already snapping.

*** Water scarcity

In dry climates, rivers and dams aren't the main source of water — it's underground aquifers. These natural reservoirs take centuries to fill but can be emptied in decades. When overdrawn, the ground above sinks, and the aquifer's capacity to hold water diminishes permanently. Mexico City is a stark example: it has sunk over 10 metres in the last century due to excessive groundwater extraction, and its water crisis is intensifying.

Cape Town faced a similar threat. In 2018, after years of drought and overuse, the city was 90 days away from 'Day Zero' — the point when municipal water supplies would be shut off, and residents would have to queue for daily rations. Through severe restrictions, public campaigns, and emergency measures, disaster was narrowly avoided. But the warning is clear: once an aquifer is depleted, no amount of rain or dams can restore it quickly. Cities worldwide are on the brink, and when the taps run dry, it's not a slow decline — it's panic, migration, collapse. You can live without oil. You can't live without water.

*** Soil degradation

Civilisations don't just fall to war — they fall when their land dies. The world's richest soils took thousands of years to form, but we're losing them 10 to 50 times faster than nature can replace them. Farming chemicals, monocultures, and over-tilling strip the earth bare until nothing will grow. The American Midwest, once the planet's breadbasket, is bleeding out. It's not just dust storms — it's the slow death of the land itself. When topsoil goes, crops fail even if it rains. You can't eat promises, you can't plant machines. Rome rotted its fields before it rotted its empire. We're doing it again — only bigger, and this time there's nowhere left to move.

*** Extreme weather

Once, floods, fires, and storms were rare disasters. Now they're just background noise. Australia, baked by record heat, swings straight into massive floods, drowning entire neighbourhoods. In Queensland, so many homes are now at risk that insurance is starting to vanish — and without insurance, communities collapse after every hit.

Europe used to fear droughts once a generation. Now southern Europe burns every summer, while storms flood cities in the north. Even North Africa, famous for deserts, saw snow falling in Morocco — a climate system wobbling where it shouldn't.

Canada is burning, flooding, and freezing all in the same year. Wildfires gut towns. Hailstorms wreck crops. Rivers spill over into cities that once thought they were safe. And the US is hammered on every front — hurricanes, megafires, endless storms. The cycle is speeding up, and every system we rely on — farming, transport, power grids — is getting hit harder, faster, and more often.

This isn't about bad luck anymore. It's the new normal, and it's only just begun.

These were just a few of the biggest cracks. There's more — and it's spreading. Ageing infrastructure built for a stable climate is failing under floods, fires, and storms — roads, bridges, power grids, all crumbling faster than we can repair them. Global fertility rates are crashing, leading to ageing, shrinking, and unstable societies. Oceans, stripped by overfishing and poisoned by runoff, are losing their ability to feed us or buffer the climate. Mass migration is building like a pressure wave as regions become unlivable. I'll break these down in the second part of this brochure.

** The age of self-destruction

You don't need data to feel it. Everyone knows something is deeply wrong. Greed isn't a glitch — it is the system. Lies aren't scandals — they're the norm. The "not my problem" mindset runs deep, from government halls to ordinary homes. Social media turns deceit into currency. Governments and corporations openly loot the future while most people look away, numbed or distracted.

Civilisations don't collapse from outside blows — they rot inside first. When truth is worthless, when honour is mocked, when life is just a game of what you can take before someone else does, collapse isn't a question. It's automatic.

Our mindset shapes our systems. If we seek profit at the expense of others and the Earth, we design economies and structures that do exactly that — and carry their own destruction inside them. Spiritual traditions saw this long ago: the world outside reflects the world within. As above, so below. When inner rot becomes normal, outer collapse becomes inevitable.

#+begin_quote
  The system we built demands infinite growth and infinite extraction in a finite, living world that cannot survive either.

** Lost eden: separation and its consequences

In the beginning, Oneness wasn't an idea — it was how humans lived. Life wasn't chopped into categories: self, world, animal, spirit. There was just life, unfolding. Drinking from a river, resting under a tree, living with the seasons — it was all one movement, one being.

This isn't philosophy. Across time, people who stepped beyond the mind — mystics, sages, deep meditators, even those under LSD or other psychedelics — describe the same thing: a direct experience of undivided life. Different cultures gave it different names — Brahman, Great Spirit, Christ Consciousness — but they all point to the same reality: when the walls of thought fall, only unity remains.

Separation was not evil. It was part of life's unfolding. Individuality, self-awareness, choice — all of these needed some degree of division. Life was not meant to stay in unconscious unity forever. But the problem came when separation forgot its roots. When humans began to see themselves as apart, above, or against the rest of life, the wound opened.

The true fall wasn't gaining knowledge. It was losing memory. Forgetting that we are branches of the same tree, not owners of it. From that forgetting grew fear, control, greed — and the systems we see collapsing today.

Returning doesn't mean erasing the self or going back to unconscious innocence. It means standing fully in individuality, fully in choice — but knowing, living, breathing the truth that all life is still one field.

The way forward isn't building a new utopia. It's remembering what we already are, and building from there.

** The path forward: conscious return to oneness

Life, when thrown out of balance, seeks to heal itself. A river that overflows does not forget how to flow; it finds a deeper channel. Likewise, humanity's excesses force a correction.

True restoration is not regression into unconscious innocence, but a conscious reunion with life. It is the growth of a strong tree rooted in both earth and sky.

We have strayed too far into separation. Correction is now inevitable. Life itself will guide the way back to a living centre — a conscious Oneness where both individuality and belonging are fulfilled.

We are not starting from zero. Even amid collapse, new seeds are stirring everywhere. Meditation, once rare and esoteric, is now mainstream. Millions routinely use practices like breathwork, binaural beats, and silent retreats — unlocking states of consciousness that were once the domain of rare mystics.

As a result, unprecedented numbers of people are glimpsing the truth beyond thought: we are not separate. Experiences of direct unity — sometimes through sudden shifts, sometimes through gradual awakening — are accelerating worldwide. Even kundalini awakenings, once a hidden rarity, are now happening at a scale no tradition ever anticipated. Even temporary glimpses through psychedelics like LSD or Ayahuasca are powerful.

This is not an accident. Life is correcting itself. As old systems break down, consciousness is breaking open. The way forward is not invention, but remembrance — living from the direct knowledge that we are one life, one being, playing through countless forms.
