* Models of collapse
** Dying imperium: lessons from history

Collapse never comes from nowhere. It builds quietly, invisibly, until the moment it can no longer be denied. Civilisations that once seemed invincible disintegrate not from a single blow, but from a thousand small fractures ignored by the proud and the powerful.

*** Sumer (c. 2100 bce)

The first known civilisation also left the first known scars. Sumerian cities flourished in Mesopotamia, driven by irrigation farming. But over centuries, intensive agriculture led to salinisation — salt buildup poisoned the soils. Crop yields collapsed. Cities emptied. Political structures fragmented. Environmental exhaustion, not foreign conquest, shattered Sumer. The lesson: even the first steps into "civilisation" carried seeds of collapse when life was reduced to extraction.

*** Ancient Egypt (Old Kingdom collapse c. 2200 bce)

Egypt offers a different pattern: not a final fall, but cycles of collapse and rebirth. The Old Kingdom ended when severe droughts shrank the Nile floods that fed Egyptian agriculture. Without regular floods, the food supply dried up. Central authority collapsed. The state disintegrated into local warlords. Egypt eventually reunited, but the cracks never fully disappeared. Environmental dependency, and the illusion of permanent abundance, would haunt Egypt across millennia.

*** Han dynasty (collapse 220 ce)

The Han Dynasty was one of China's golden ages — but like all great empires, it rotted from within. Overexpansion drained the treasury. Land concentration in the hands of the elite squeezed the peasantry into desperation. Corruption flourished. When natural disasters struck, the fragile social contract snapped. Massive peasant revolts — like the Yellow Turban Rebellion — shattered central authority. The empire splintered into warring factions. The Han collapsed not from a lack of strength, but from internal rot ignored until it was too late.

*** The fall of Rome (476 ce)

Rome rotted long before it fell. In its desperation to fund endless wars and bloated bureaucracy, Rome debased its silver coinage — cutting more base metals into coins while pretending they were still pure. Trust evaporated. Prices soared as coins lost real value. Soldiers demanded higher pay. Merchants demanded more coins for the same goods. Inflation shredded the economy at its core[fn::Yes, inflation happened already in antiquity, some 1,500 years before fiat became a thing.].

Meanwhile, greedy expansion stripped forests and drained soils, weakening the food base. Taxes crushed the free peasantry, forcing millions into dependence and servitude. Political decay ran rampant — a bloated bureaucracy, leaders obsessed with their own survival, not the survival of the state. Rome's armies, once feared across the world, degenerated into mercenaries with no loyalty beyond pay. By the time the "barbarians" crossed the borders, Rome was already a corpse. They simply tore down what was hollow.

*** Mayan collapse (c. 900 ce)

At the height of their civilisation, the Maya built towering cities and elaborate temples — but at a fatal cost. Forests were razed for farmland. The soil, pushed beyond its limits, began to fail. As droughts struck, the elites responded not with reform, but with even grander monuments and blood rituals, desperate to hold onto crumbling power. Resources that could have fed the people were spent on displays of fading glory. As famine spread, cities emptied, power structures dissolved, and the jungle reclaimed what was left. The Maya didn't simply collapse — they sacrificed themselves on the altar of denial.

*** Easter island (collapse by c. 1600 ce)

Few stories are starker than Easter Island. A once-forested paradise turned into barren grassland. In their obsession with building larger and larger stone statues, the islanders felled every tree, destroyed their ability to fish, and exhausted their soil. With no timber, no boats, and no way to escape, the society collapsed into war, starvation, and cannibalism. By the time Europeans arrived, Easter Island was a haunted wasteland — the silent ruins of a people who quite literally built themselves into extinction.

*** Dutch empire (decline 17th–18th centuries)

The Dutch Republic rose to dominate the world through trade, shipping, and colonial extraction. Amsterdam became the centre of global commerce, controlling sea routes, establishing the first modern stock exchange, and founding financial institutions that shaped modern capitalism. For a time, the Netherlands held more wealth, more ships, and more influence than any other nation on Earth.

But as wealth accumulated, the Dutch economy shifted away from production and naval dominance into finance. Capital increasingly flowed into speculation rather than renewal. The infamous Tulip Mania of 1636–1637 was a warning: an entire economy inflating bubbles divorced from real value. Even after the tulip crash, speculative bubbles in commodities, shipping, and shares continued to rise and fall. The financial sector grew bloated while military investment stagnated. When wars with Britain and France strained the Dutch navy and trade networks, the financialised economy could not compensate. Debt soared. The state's ability to project power collapsed under its own financial weight.

By the 18th century, Dutch banks were no longer fuelling Dutch expansion — they were financing the rise of Britain. The flow of wealth reversed. Amsterdam, once the centre of world finance, became a second-tier city. The Dutch Empire did not fall to invasion; it fell because its financial system hollowed out the productive core, leaving a rich but defenceless shell. Like Rome before them and America after, the Dutch drowned in the illusion of paper wealth while their real strength decayed.

*** Aztec empire (collapse 1521 ce)

The Aztecs built a stunning imperial system centred on Tenochtitlán, a city of engineering marvels with causeways, aqueducts, and floating gardens. Their empire expanded rapidly through warfare, extracting tribute in goods, food, and captives from a network of conquered city-states. But the system was brittle. It was built not on integration, but domination. Subject peoples resented Aztec rule deeply, trapped in a cycle of heavy taxation and human sacrifice to feed the religious and political machinery of the empire.

By the late 1400s, environmental stress began to hit. Severe droughts struck the Valley of Mexico, pressuring agriculture and thinning food supplies. Instead of reform, the Aztec elites responded with religious escalation: launching Flower Wars specifically to capture more prisoners for sacrifice, believing that greater bloodshed would restore divine favour. Resources that could have strengthened resilience were funnelled into ritual militarism. The empire became overextended, internally hated, and rigid at the very moment it needed flexibility.

When the Spanish arrived, it was not their guns or horses that doomed the Aztecs — it was the internal fractures already gaping. Tens of thousands of indigenous allies from subjugated peoples joined Cortés in the siege of Tenochtitlán. Disease played its part later, but the real collapse was political, social, and ecological. The Aztec system, based on extraction without renewal, was already cracking apart. The Spanish conquest was not the beginning of the end — it was the final blow to an empire that had hollowed itself from within.

*** British empire (decline 1914–1947)

The British Empire once ruled over a quarter of the world's land and people. Its wealth was built on colonial extraction: India's resources, African labour, Caribbean plantations, and the global domination of trade routes. London became the financial centre of the world. British industry, backed by military force and maritime supremacy, forged an empire where the sun never set. But behind the grandeur, extraction hollowed both the colonies and the empire itself. The wealth that flowed into Britain was unsustainable without constant expansion — and cracks were already appearing by the end of the 19th century.

The real collapse began with the two World Wars. Britain exhausted its economic and human resources fighting Germany twice in a generation. After 1918, it emerged weakened but still dominant; after 1945, it was shattered. Debt skyrocketed. The cost of maintaining far-flung colonies became unbearable. The pound sterling collapsed from its position as global reserve currency. Key colonies like India, the so-called “jewel of the empire,” demanded and won independence. Britain's global influence fractured along with its economy, and its navy, once the symbol of unmatched power, was eclipsed by the United States.

By the mid-20th century, Britain no longer ruled the waves — it borrowed from America to survive. Financialisation and reliance on colonial wealth had postponed the reckoning, but could not prevent it. The empire that had once dictated the rules of the global system became a minor partner in a new American-led order. Britain's fate is a textbook case of how extraction economies, no matter how sophisticated, eventually collapse when their cost outgrows their ability to expand — a mirror now facing the United States itself.

*** Echoes in the modern world

The flaws that ended Sumer, Egypt, Rome, the Aztecs, the Dutch, and the British are not relics of ancient history. They are alive — amplified — in the modern world.

- Environmental exhaustion:
  Topsoil loss, aquifer depletion, climate chaos — a global mirror of Sumer, the Maya, and Easter Island.
- Elite denial and ritual escalation:
  Instead of addressing collapse, today's elites funnel resources into distractions: financial speculation, greenwashing, digital bread and circuses — modern equivalents of blood rituals and imperial games.
- Over-financialisation:
  Like the Dutch, real production has been hollowed out. The global economy floats on a speculative sea of debt, derivatives, and fiat promises untethered from land, labour, or real goods.
- Overstretch and resentment:
  Like Rome and the British Empire, the current imperial core (led by the United States) is overstretched militarily, politically, and economically — resented rather than admired by much of the world.
- Internal fracturing:
  Societies polarised, social trust broken, institutions crumbling from within — a pattern seen at the end of every past empire.

*** A system beyond repair

The world today does not suffer from one disease — it suffers from all of them, layered and compounded. Every failure that ended ancient empires is active now, operating simultaneously, synchronised across the planet. Environmental collapse, financial hollowing, political decay, social breakdown — not in isolation, but interlocked and feeding on each other. The cracks are no longer regional. They are global. The infection is systemic.

Never before has collapse been so complete. Rome fell, but China endured. The Maya vanished, but Andean civilisations survived. Sumer rotted, but Egypt rose again. Past collapses were partial, scattered, recoverable. Today it is different. This time, it is planetary. No region stands apart. No empire waits to inherit the ashes. What we are facing is not just another fall — it is a total disintegration of the old global system.

It is unprecedented. No collapse in history comes close to the scale, speed, and interconnectedness of what is now unfolding. And while collapse is certain, what rises after it — that remains unwritten.
