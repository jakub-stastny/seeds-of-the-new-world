* New hope

  Here's the thing: many people are already living in the new Earth. It's been such a quiet shift, many never noticed it. Yet, the wise don't need to shout and the truly powerful don't need to hit. More and more people joined the silent non-movement and started to grow their own produce, use eco-friendly technology and mainly -- and very much in line with the sleeping phoenix -- they took the responsibility for themselves.

** What I'm doing

  I want to add my example simply to show what's manageable for a single normal person to do. Because it's not really about what could theoretically be done (after spending 20 years studying it), but what's doable, manageable and realistic to learn and build within few short years.

  First, I identified an area of interest: a South-facing slope between Cuernavaca and Mexico City with very temperate climate (due to thermal dynamics on the slope, hot air raises along the slope during the day and due to decent forest cover in the area that maintains the temperature stable) and even more importantly -- abundant rainfall.

  I visited the area. My goal was to search on the lower parts of the slope, but since the bus stops in a town on the upper side, I went there. I immediately loved it -- I knew it was the right place to search. We asked a random person whether they know about lands for sale -- and he happened to have a family member that did.
